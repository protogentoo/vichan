Well.  I pretty much buchered my gentoo installation momentum.
but I shall not give up on emacs.

    - now in terms of use, I don't know how to fuck with it.
      .. point is I'll have to use emacs on daily bases and put it to muscle memory.
      .. I'll have to do it if I desire to work with emacs in the future instead of some gay IDE.

What is this for?  GNOTES aka GENERAL NOTES are for taking general notes at first
and then spliting them into there own special categorized by
file notes in a special little folder
for this little imageboard project.

    > focusing on imageboard
      .. due to it's useage of HTLL, CSS, JS, PHP and SQL.
      .. on the side I'll also learn how to configure emacs using ELISP

    > gentoo uses lenguages that I do not require of right now.
